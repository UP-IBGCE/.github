## Welcome on the Individual-based Global Change Ecology (IBGCE) group from Potsdam Universität! 

Here will be posted all relevant outputs from the IBGCE university research focus (UFS). Our work revolves around two founding articles:
- Jeltsch et al. 2025. The need for an individual-based global change ecology. *Individual-based Ecology*. https://doi.org/10.3897/ibe.1.148200
- Ehrlich et al. *in prep*. Ecological coupling across spatio-temporal scales: Knowledge gaps and research priorities in a changing world. 

This GitHub will be used mostly for collaboration with members outside of Potsdam Universität and for sharing open source codes attached to publications. The organisation for repositories is not settled yet. 

### Contribution guidelines

General:
- As always on GitHub, try to be specific when describing your repositories (the best is to add a Read Me file containing all important informations), branches, commits and pull requests.
- Your outputs deserve protection, make sure to add a license file to your repositories. For open source codes, use the MIT license.

Collaborative code editing:
- Prefer a "private" setting for collaborative code editing, you can set a "public" setting later on when the final outputs are ready.
- If several persons are working on the same files or if you are unsure about the modifications you are submitting, make sure to create an alternate branch from the "main" branch to protect previous works as well as your work. Even if GitHub tracks modifications, it can be very difficult to follow them when the branch system is poorly handled.

Code sharing:
- Do not forget to set your repository as "public" so anyone can access your wonderful outputs.
